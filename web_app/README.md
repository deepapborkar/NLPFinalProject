## Description

I created a very simple flask web app that allows you to test reviews against the best models found from this project. The best models are the ones with the lowest validation loss during the training process for the BOW, LSTM, GRU classifiers. 

## Instructions

In order to run the web app locally on your machine, run the following command in the same location as the app.py:
flask run

Then navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ on a web browser.
