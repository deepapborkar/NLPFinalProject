## Project Description

Sentiment analysis is a very common NLP task. There are many papers exploring different techniques to complete this task. I wanted to explore some of these models to get a better understanding of some of the models within deep learning that are used for NLP tasks. So, for this project, I set out to complete a sentiment analysis on movie reviews using deep learning techniques. \\
